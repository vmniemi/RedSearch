RedSearch is a tool for accessing publicly available Reddit content only. It fetches user comments and posts that are visible to anyone on Reddit without bypassing any authentication or accessing private content.

Important Notes:

Public Content Only:

RedSearch only retrieves data from public subreddits and user profiles.

Private subreddits, restricted posts, or deleted content cannot be accessed.

Rate Limits and Responsible Use:

The tool respects Reddit’s rate limits for unauthenticated requests (~60 requests per minute).

Excessive automated requests may be flagged; use responsibly.

User-Agent Compliance:

All requests include a custom User-Agent to identify the script, following Reddit API guidelines.

Personal Use:

RedSearch is intended for personal research, reference, or analysis.

Republishing, reselling, or redistributing large volumes of Reddit content may violate Reddit’s Terms of Service.

By using RedSearch, you agree to use the tool responsibly and only for content that is publicly available on Reddit. The developers are not responsible for misuse of the tool.
